This file defines a data source for querying data.

There are three parts to defining a data source:

* Defining column options via a Column class
* Defining table options via a DatasourceTable
* Defining the query mechanism via a Query class

Note that you can define multiple Column and Table classes
in the same file. Each Table class needs to associate with a
Query class by specifying the _query_class attribute.
