Riverbed SteelScript Application Framework
==========================================

**Riverbed SteelScript** is a collection of libraries and scripts written in Python for interacting
with Riverbed appliances and solutions, and other network infrastructure devices.

As part of the Riverbed SteelScript the **SteelScript Application Framework** makes it easy to create a fully
custom web application that mashes up data from multiple sources.  It comes
pre-configured with several reports for NetProfiler and NetShark.

Quick Start
-----------

If you already have pip, just run the following (in a
`virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_):

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install steelscript
   $ steel install

Not sure about pip, but you know you have Python?

1. Download ``steel_bootstrap.py`` `from here <https://support.riverbed.com/apis/steelscript/index.html#quick-start>`_

2. Run it (in a `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_):

   .. code:: bash

      $ python steel_bootstrap.py install

Once you have the base ``steelscript`` package installed, getting started
is just a few commands away:

.. code:: bash

   $ steel install --appfwk
   $ steel appfwk mkproject

This will populate a local directory with all the files you need to run
the server in "dev" mode on your local system.
